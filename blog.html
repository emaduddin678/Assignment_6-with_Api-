          <h1>var</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>- Function-scoped.</li>
            <li>
              - Hoisted to the top of their containing function or script.
            </li>
            <li>- Can be redeclared within the same scope.</li>
          </ol>
          <h1>let</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>- Block-scoped (limited to the nearest enclosing block).</li>
            <li>- Not hoisted to the top of their block.</li>
            <li>- Cannot be redeclared within the same scope.</li>
          </ol>
          <h1>const</h1>
          <ol>
            <li>- Block-scoped (same as `let`).</li>
            <li>
              - Must be assigned a value at declaration and cannot be
              reassigned.
            </li>
            <li>
              - Objects and arrays declared with `const` are not immutable;
              their properties or elements can be modified, but they cannot be
              reassigned to a new object or array.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <details>
          <summary>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</summary>
          

          <ol>
            <li>undefined typically represents the absence of a value or the uninitialized state of a variable. It often occurs as the default value for function parameters or uninitialized variables.</li>
            <li>
              null is explicitly assigned to indicate that a variable or object property intentionally has no value or represents the absence of an object.
            </li>
            
          </ol>

          <summary>What do you mean by REST API?</summary>
         

          <p style="margin-left: 30px;">
            <strong>REST API</strong> (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and follows the principles of statelessness and resource-based architecture to allow clients to request and manipulate data resources on a server over the internet. REST APIs are widely used for web applications to enable communication between different software systems or services.
